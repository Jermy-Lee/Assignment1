    5. VEL 46 (SMG)</li>
    <br>
  <div class="font">
    The VEL 46, AKA the MP7, has a potential <span class="green">TTK of 189ms</span> which is competitive, but still slightly slower than some other SMGs. However, it does have a very high fire rate of <span class="green">952 rpm</span> as well as a <span class="green"> 40 round magazine</span>. This makes the VEL 46 an extremely forgiving gun and an excellent choice for casual players who are not as confident in their aim.    </div>

    <br>
    While it is usually better to utilise all five attachment slots on your gun, the VEL 46 is notably most effective with only three attachments; The <span class="green">Commando Foregrip</span>, the <span class="green">Slimline Pro Optic</span> and the <span class="green">VLK LZR 7MW Laser</span>.
