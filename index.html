  Top 5 Guns

  <li class="font-section">
    5. VEL 46 (SMG)</li>
    <br>
  <div class="font">
    The VEL 46, AKA the MP7, has a potential <span class="green">TTK of 189ms</span> which is competitive, but still slightly slower than some other SMGs. However, it does have a very high fire rate of <span class="green">952 rpm</span> as well as a <span class="green"> 40-round magazine</span>. This makes the VEL 46 an extremely forgiving gun and an excellent choice for casual players who are not as confident in their aim.   </div>

    <br>
    While it is usually better to utilise all five attachment slots on your gun, the VEL 46 is notably most effective with only three attachments; The <span class="green">Commando Foregrip</span>, the <span class="green">Slimline Pro Optic</span> and the <span class="green">VLK LZR 7MW Laser</span>.

    4. STB 556(Assault Rifle)</li>
    <br>
    <div class="font">
    The STB 556 is excellent for aggressive players. Its incredibly fast <span class="green">Sprint to Fire </span>speed of <span class="green">83ms</span>, <span class="green">158ms</span> when tactical sprinting, allows you to almost always come out on top in close range fights. Not to mention, it has an incredibly fast <span class="green">TTK of 162ms</span>.</div>

The ideal attachments for the STB 556 are the <span class="green">Sakin Thread-40 Muzzle</span>, the <span class="green">FSS Sharkfin 90 Underbarrel</span>, the <span class="green">FTAC C11 Riser Comb</span>, the <span class="green">Slimline Pro Optic</span> and the <span class="green">VLK LZR 7MW Laser</span>.
