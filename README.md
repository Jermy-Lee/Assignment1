# Call of Duty: Gun Guide
This project is a website named Call of Duty: Gun Guide. Its goal is to introduce new players to the newest Call of Duty game, Modern Warfare II. It also acts as a guide for creating the best set-ups for the best guns in the game. There are many websites that do this but what makes Gun Guide unique is that it's the only one that provides statistics to back up its claims. 

## Design Process
The project's focus is the game Modern Warfare II. In Modern Warfare II, if you are not using the best guns with the best attachments, it would be extremely hard to perform well in the game against players who are. As a casual player, I want to be able to compete with other players who are already familiar with the game. Hence, the project was created for these casual players or newer players so that they can achieve a level playing field with more serious players. 

The reason why my website is the best way for them to do this is because of the accuracy and depth of the information provided. My website provides statistics like TTK and ADS speed, which no other website does. While these statistics were taken from a third-party source on YouTube, I found these statistics to be accurate in my own testing and I can guarantee that the margin of error is only a few milliseconds. Most importantly, the information provided is catered specifically to my target audience, newer players. If you follow the guide, you will definitely find that these gun set-ups are easy to use, even if you are a newer player. 

However, the project is also perfect for more advanced players to utilise. As an advanced player, I would want to find the perfect gun set-ups to be able to elevate my gameplay to the next level. The information provided by this project will allow advanced players to do exactly that.

Aside from content, the website was also designed to use a simple colour palette. A black background with white and green accents. This specific colour palette was used as it can also be found in the focus of the project, the game, Modern Warfare II. It adds a sense of familiarity to the project for those who play the game as well as simply being visually appealing.
