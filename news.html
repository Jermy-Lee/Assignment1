  What's New
</h1>
<p class="font">With the Season 1 update having just been released, we thought it would be appropriate to share with you some of the changes that were made. The most important change was the <span class="green">addition of three guns</span>, the <span class="green">M13b Assault Rifle</span>, the <span class="green">Bas-P SMG</span>, better known as the AAC Honey Badger in real life, and the <span class="green">Victus XMR Sniper Rifle</span>. Whether these guns are worth using is yet to be seen. We are currently testing them and will update you as soon as possible. <span class="green">Tier One Modes</span> were also added to the game. <span class="green">Tier One</span> is essentially a realism mode for core 6 vs 6 multiplayer, you have <span class="green">no HUD</span> and <span class="green">half your normal health</span> which also means you die twice as fast. This game mode creates a more tactical style of gameplay as it forces you to be more attentive and careful. Finally, a very important change was the <span class="green">increments to the game's footstep audio</span>. This makes wearing headphones and listening out for enemy footsteps an incredibly vital part of the gameplay.</p>
