  About FPSGhosts
</h1>
<div class="font">The Call of Duty franchise has spanned 42 games over the course of 19 years. Their latest game, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II, has just released on October 28th and FPSGhosts decided to create a website to help introduce new players to this amazing franchise. The website is, of course, named Call of Duty: Gun Guide and our devs at FPSGhosts are committed to helping casual players experience the best of Modern Warfare II.</div>
<br>
<div class="font">FPSGhosts is a Call of Duty interest group that was founded in December 2019. The researchers at FPSGhosts spend hours hand-testing weapon attributes such as TTK, Time To Kill, RPM, Rounds Per Minute, and Sprint to Fire speed to provide you with the most accurate information possible. Our website devs spent weeks creating Gun Guide and will continue to update you on Call of Duty news as well as the best guns following the updates to come.</div>
